# NinjaSpaceMonkeys Band Website
This is a website for a fictional band called NinjaSpaceMonkeys.  The purpose of this website is to promote the bands material in order to attract potential fans/customers to the band. The website consists of 2 pages which is the main page which serves to pull attention to the band and the merchandise page is to allow for e-commerce of the bands goods such as albums and t-shirts etc.
 
## Design Process
The band has a colour pallete of red, blue and yellow and represents the band members Rook, Gabriel and Sam respectively. These colours are littered accross the website as a form of branding. Since this is a band, the music and videos must be at the forefront of the design, so showcasing it would be a must. The target audience of the band is mostly teenage girls so the overall website design should be more cute and colourful instead of minimalistic and boring. 

## Features

Latest Gig Headline: It displays the latest gig of the band and when clicked, would cause a pop-up form to appear for users to register.

### Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project from Gorillaz and One Direction

One Direction because it is a boy band and its main fanbase is teenage girls and Gorillaz because it is a virtual band where the band members are actually fictional characters. A mix of both created NinjaSpaceMonkeys.
